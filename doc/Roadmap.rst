Roadmap

Planned features
================

The following features are planned:

error bars
   add error bars to scatter plots

web server
   implement setting up and http server with web.py

latex/pdf
   test latex/pdf rendering of documents

data download
   add method to provide data from cache from the
   command line and possibly the web pages.

add automatic history
    keep automatic track of releases/versions of
    the document.

add :as-percent: option
    display proportions optionally as percent

examine memory usage
    large datasets require a large amount of memory,
    investigate if this can be optimized, for example
    by using numpy more efficiently

plugin architecture
    clean up Renderer.py so that adding custom renderers
    will become easy. Consider adding a generic interface
    to matplotlib plotting functions.

upload
    add upload to galaxy and/or UCSC

rpy integration
    check if it is possible to use rpy as rendering engine and
    for statistical tests.

optional pdf support
    pdf rendering takes a while and could be post-poned until
    final document is produced. Similarly, pdf scatter plots 
    with many points take a long while to render and these should
    be thinned.

investigate netCDF/HFS5 support
   as data sources or as ways to store the data instead of shelve?


Version 1.1
===========

The following features have been added in version 1.1

Completed features
------------------

error bars
   added error bars to bar plots

colored scatter plotter
   add individual coloring option for dots in a 
   scatter plot

load balancing
    achieve better load balancing between processes instead
    of giving each process a fixed amount of work no matter
    how long it will take.

logging
    added summary of logging messages to ``sphinxreport-build``.

multi-figure layout
   implemented multi-figure layout using option
   :layout: <>, where <> is column(default), row or grid.

added mpl-* options
   for fine-tuning plots, matplotlib configuration options
   can be set on a per-plot basis.

clean
   also remove files in _build/html/_sources and _doctrees
   that match to trackers.

multiprocessing
   better exception handling

test
   better output of available trackers - remove all
   objects that are not trackers.

windows compatibility
    check windows installation process and usage.
    Works in windows XP with python xy.

explorer output
    check output on windows explorer - frames do not appear on
    Chris' machine. Works on Windows XP, IE 8.

datatypes
   The nomenclature of datatypes was non-intuitive. Did away with 
   it and had each Renderer test for correctly formatted input.

add hinton plot
   added hinton plot (see http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib)

--force option
   add --clean or --force option to sphinxreport-test or build
   automatically force a new build. See also the corresponding
   sphinx-build options.

changed API
   changed model to use Dispatcher, Renderer and Transformer
   to disentangle figuring what to plot, plotting and data 
   transformation.

exceptions
   exceptions in trackers and renderers are added as .. warning
   blocks.

Known problems
--------------

matrix plot legend
   fix long legend text for matrix plots. The size of the legend
   is too small.

legend
   fix dimensioning of outer legend. Maybe add a separate
   legend plot.
