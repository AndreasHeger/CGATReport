!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!

SphinxReport is a report generator that is implemented as an extension
to <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>.

Its purpose is to facilitate
writing scientific reports interpreting large and changing datasets. It is
designed to assist the iterative analysis during the development of a
computational scientific pipeline as understanding of the data grows.
Once the pipeline settles down, SphinxReport permits an easy transition
towards the automatic report generation needed when the pipeline is
run on new data sets.

SphinxReport is easy to use and powerful
enough to give all the flexibility needed during the development of computational pipelines and robustness during the
production use of a pipeline.
It is intended for developers and computational scientists with <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a>
scripting experience.

SphinxReport comes with all the batteries included thanks to <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> and <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>,
in particular, it

  * uses simple markup in the form of <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">restructured text</a>,
  * supports both automated and narrative analysis,
  * keeps code, data and text together,
  * takes care of indexing and formatting to produce something presentable,
  * produces static html, latex, ps and pdf.
